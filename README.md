# Blackjack game
##### Live: https://bartoszmrosek.github.io/Blackjack-Game/
My implementation of game "blackjack". The purpose is to get to 21 in as little cards as possible while not going over. This can be done by joining to multiple seat with proper bets, game defaults on 1000 â‚¬. After joing player can start game with proper button on top. There would appear 3 options (1 might not be enabled if funds are scarce enough) that manipulates given seat cards. After all players makes their decisions game uses presenter to give cards to compare to, on this game decides if user won/lost or got blackjack.
